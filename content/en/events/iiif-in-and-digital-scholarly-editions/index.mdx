    between developers of IIIF applications in libraries and digital scholarly
    editors.

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is aimed at enabling data exchange of image data and their description and annotation via software interfaces (APIs). Digital scholarly editions share this overarching objective, but focus mostly on data transmitted in textual form. The advantages of using IIIF have been discussed for some time under the keyword “Distributed Editions”. The two-day workshop is intended to enable an exchange between developers of IIIF applications in libraries and digital scholarly editors.

### Programme

The workshop starts on May 7, 2025 at 12:00, and ends on May 8, 13:30. We are happy to announce presentations by Glen Robson (IIIF Technical Coordinator), Rainer Simon (Recogito) and Leander Seige (Handschriftenportal).
