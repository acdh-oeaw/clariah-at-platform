    DARIAH enhances and supports digitally-enabled research and teaching across the arts and humanities. DARIAH is a network of people, expertise, information, knowledge, content, methods, tools and technologies from its member countries. It develops, maintains and operates an infrastructure in support of ICT-based research practices and sustains researchers in using them to build, analyse and interpret digital resources.
  </GridItem>

CLARIAH-AT consortium members are actively involved in the following DARIAH Committees:

* National Coordinator’s Committee (NCC)

  Each DARIAH Member Country has its own National Coordinator, who oversees DARIAH activities in his or her country on behalf of its national membership consortium. These activities are the setting up of a national road map for the digitally enabled arts and humanities, and coordinating the submission of in-kind contributions, such as the tools, services, software, collections, expertise and researcher networks that are established as a result of implementing the respective national road map.

    K-centres **share their knowledge and expertise** on one or more aspects of the domain covered by the CLARIN infrastructure.

    The focus of CLARIN is on language resources (in all modalities, from all regions and with any topical orientation) and K-centres serve researchers and educators from any discipline where language plays one of its many roles, ranging from object of study, a means of communication or expression, a means to store and extract information, object of learning or teaching activities, to training source for data-driven analytics, and many others.

* **TRTC - Terminology Resources and Translation Corpora**

  This K-Centre is located at the University of Vienna, Centre for Translation Studies:

  The K-centre provides information and training to users on the preparation and documentation of translation-related resources, in particular terminology resources and translation corpora. This includes inquiries submitted to the Helpdesk related to tools, methods, data, and guidance in seeking further expert support. The service does not focus on language resources in particular languages, but is language independent.

## **Earlier Activities**

Part of earlier CLARIAH-AT activities were the three [**go!digital calls**](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/foerderungen/godigital) in 2014, 2016 and 2018, which were competitively advertised and organized by the Austrian Academy of Sciences with funding from the Austrian National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development. The 30 projects selected by international experts promote the development and use of innovative digital methods in Austrian humanities research. In addition, 20 CLARIAH-AT funded projects are in the implementation phase (or have recently been completed).
