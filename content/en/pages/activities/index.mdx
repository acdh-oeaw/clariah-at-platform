The CLARIAH-AT consortium members are actively involved in numerous bodies at the European level. Particularly noteworthy are:

### **DARIAH-EU**

**DARIAH stands for *Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities*.**

    DARIAH enhances and supports digitally-enabled research and teaching across the arts and humanities. DARIAH is a network of people, expertise, information, knowledge, content, methods, tools and technologies from its member countries. It develops, maintains and operates an infrastructure in support of ICT-based research practices and sustains researchers in using them to build, analyse and interpret digital resources.
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

CLARIAH-AT consortium members are actively involved in the following DARIAH Committees:

* National Coordinator’s Committee (NCC)

  Each DARIAH Member Country has its own National Coordinator, who oversees DARIAH activities in his or her country on behalf of its national membership consortium. These activities are the setting up of a national road map for the digitally enabled arts and humanities, and coordinating the submission of in-kind contributions, such as the tools, services, software, collections, expertise and researcher networks that are established as a result of implementing the respective national road map.

* Joint Research Committee (JRC)

  The JRC organises the integration of DARIAH’s technical developments and innovation activities. It is chaired by DARIAH’s Chief Integration Officer (CIO) and consists of the Heads of each of DARIAH’s Virtual Competency Centres.

### **DARIAH Working Groups**

Working groups are joint activities in DARIAH. They are self-organized and work in a strategic area that is defined by DARIAH's Virtual Competence Centres. Their activities are complementary to individual contributions from DARIAH members. Working groups always have a certain purpose: They lead to services for the community, which can be scholarly, technical, editorial or organisational. This means, they contribute to building up and extending the DARIAH infrastructure.

Members of the CLARIAH-AT Consortium are contributing to the following Working Groups:

    **Ethics and Legality in the Digital Arts and Humanities** (ELDAH)

    In the age of digital information technology and the constant availability of information through the Internet, it is not only important to have democratic access to knowledge, but also essential to consider the potential that lies in the critical production and expansion of knowledge.

    Of particular interest and concern to cultural heritage institutions and Humanities scholars are issues of copyright on, provision of and access to digitized material. There is a recognizable political drive in the European Union to facilitate free and public access to cultural heritage and research data in general hosted at publicly funded institutions. However, the lack of legal harmonization and the diverse and often unclear national legislations on the use and provision of resources by public cultural heritage or research and education institutions has been prohibiting a much broader engagement.

    **Digital Humanities Course Registry** (DHCR)

    The DH Course Registry offers a map-based search environment that gives access to a database that contains information on Digital Humanities courses.&#x20;

    The goal of the DH Course Registry is to provide information to:

    * students and researchers who intend to take up a study in the field of Digital Humanities
    * lecturers who are looking for examples of good practices in the DH field or want to promote their own DH-related teaching activities and material, and
    * administrators who aim to attract and facilitate international student and staff mobility and exchange.

  <GridItem alignment="stretch">
    **Thesaurus Maintenance**

    This Working Group aims at designing and establishing an overarching thesaurus for the humanities, focussing on identifying the top-level-concepts (facets and hierarchies) that become its common basis, meeting the demands for objectivity and interdisciplinarity. In this effort they exploit all the advantages offered by categorical semantics, in order to define the essential properties of the general concepts under which they subsume more specific terms. The definition of the essential properties of the top level-concepts, which are acceptable regardless of the scientific field in which they apply, enables the classification in a consistent and objective way. One of the major advantages of this kind of classification is the potential of a sustainable and manageable expansion of the thesauri into new areas of knowledge, in which it continues to be effective and efficient, without forcing the experts to abandon their terminology. Furthermore, it enables collaboration, cross-disciplinary resource discovery, and detection of common principles and ensures compatibility with other thesauri that are restricted to particular areas of knowledge.

    **Community Engagement**

    Engagement with digital tools, methods and content is an emerging practice for a majority of Arts and Humanities research practitioners. The best method for stimulating engagement, increasing awareness and creative use of the large volume of research data being digitised across Europe and elsewhere, as well as promoting research infrastructures, is to support communities of researchers in coming together to learn one from another, express their needs and share new ideas.

  <GridItem alignment="stretch">
    K-centres **share their knowledge and expertise** on one or more aspects of the domain covered by the CLARIN infrastructure.

    The focus of CLARIN is on language resources (in all modalities, from all regions and with any topical orientation) and K-centres serve researchers and educators from any discipline where language plays one of its many roles, ranging from object of study, a means of communication or expression, a means to store and extract information, object of learning or teaching activities, to training source for data-driven analytics, and many others.

* **TRTC - Terminology Resources and Translation Corpora**

  This K-Centre is located at the University of Vienna, Centre for Translation Studies:

  The K-centre provides information and training to users on the preparation and documentation of translation-related resources, in particular terminology resources and translation corpora. This includes inquiries submitted to the Helpdesk related to tools, methods, data, and guidance in seeking further expert support. The service does not focus on language resources in particular languages, but is language independent.

## **Earlier Activities**

Part of earlier CLARIAH-AT activities were the three [**go!digital calls**](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/foerderungen/godigital) in 2014, 2016 and 2018, which were competitively advertised and organized by the Austrian Academy of Sciences with funding from the Austrian National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development. The 30 projects selected by international experts promote the development and use of innovative digital methods in Austrian humanities research. In addition, various CLARIAH-AT funded projects are in the implementation phase (or have recently been completed).
