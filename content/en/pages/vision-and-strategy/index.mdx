## National Digital Humanities Strategy

In 2015, the group was commissioned by the responsible ministry to develop a strategic document, the [DH-Austria Strategy](https://doi.org/10.1553/DH-AUSTRIA-STRATEGIE-2015), which served as a roadmap for the sustainable establishment of the Digital Humanities in Austria.

The new strategy paper [Digital Humanities Austria Strategy 2021+](http://gams.uni-graz.at/o:clariah.dha-strategie-2021-en) (EN) is based on preliminary work by the consortium and a consultation of the Austrian professional community in the field of Digital Humanities. It defines four guidelines for the future development of Digital Humanities in Austria and serves as a work program for the CLARIAH-AT consortium:

* Research infrastructures and networks
* Research data and repositories
* Methods, and tools
* Education, training and knowledge transfer

In the current work period 2024-26, the CLARIAH-AT consortium is carrying out a diverse program of activities to advance and support the further development of Digital Humanities in Austria. In addition to networking events and workshops, the CLARIAH-AT consortium is particularly committed to promoting DH projects and young scholars.
