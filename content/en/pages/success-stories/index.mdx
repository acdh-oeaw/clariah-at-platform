> I had the privilege of attending the DH conference in Lisbon in July 2025, which explored topics such as accessibility, slow research, and critical reflection. The WoGeM mini-conference format was particularly valuable, allowing me to receive feedback on my master’s project on queer activism and to develop perspectives for a potential PhD. This conference has profoundly shaped my view of Digital Humanities, introducing me to new methods, concepts, and the vital importance of ethics, diversity, and mindful research practices. I leave inspired, with fresh ideas and meaningful connections.

> I am not an archaeologist—and that is precisely what made the CAA conference in Athens so inspiring for me. I experienced firsthand how exciting the exchange between archaeology, digital methods, and interdisciplinary research can be, and how digital tools can bring research to life and make culture tangible.
>
> Particularly fascinating was the discussion on artificial intelligence and its impact on our work and the perception of heritage. The conference showed me how essential networking, innovation, and reflection are—and how enriching it is to be part of this community.

> At SimAUD 2025 in Madrid, I had the opportunity to present my Python tool for climate-adaptive building simulations and to discuss it directly with international experts. The conference highlighted for me the importance of connecting technical innovations with social, historical, and cultural perspectives on cities. Particularly inspiring was seeing how digital tools not only process data but also help make cities more just, sustainable, and resilient. This experience has profoundly broadened my view of the role of Digital Humanities in urban research.

> The Corpus Linguistics Conference 2025 was a true highlight for me: I had the opportunity to present my own research while gaining exciting insights into the projects of other scholars. The discussions on methods, AI, and language quantification opened up entirely new perspectives for me. Particularly valuable was the exchange with international PhD students and colleagues—pure inspiration! I am taking away a rich mix of knowledge, new ideas, and contacts.&#x20;

> My participation in the Winter School on “Intangible Cultural Heritage” at the University of Groningen was extremely rewarding. Through workshops, keynotes, and interdisciplinary discussions, I gained new perspectives on the documentation and preservation of ephemeral art. Particularly inspiring was the hands-on approach to teaching ephemeral art forms and the exchange with colleagues from diverse disciplines. The event has greatly expanded my ideas for technological approaches to preserving intangible cultural heritage. I now move forward into the next phase of my research feeling both strengthened and inspired.

> Thanks to the support of CLARIAH-AT, I was able to attend the 21st International Morphology Meeting, presenting both a talk and my first poster. This experience greatly deepened my knowledge of digital analysis methods and historical linguistics. In particular, the exchange with international researchers opened up new perspectives and strengthened my presentation skills. Attending was a decisive step for me in further developing my academic profile.

> Thanks to the CLARIAH Travel Grant, I was able to attend the ESSLLI Summer School in Leuven in the summer of 2024. There, I presented my research on LLMs and posthumanism and received valuable feedback through the intensive peer-review process. The interdisciplinary discussions with participants from linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and ethics greatly broadened my perspective on AI and Digital Humanities. Particularly enriching was the combination of theoretical insights and methodological knowledge, which inspired me both professionally and personally.

> DHd 2024 in Passau was a true highlight for me! In particular, the workshops on APIs and Large Language Models broadened my horizons, and the valuable feedback at the Doctoral Consortium provided new impulses for my dissertation project. I was fascinated by the many insights into digital editions, computational literary studies, and ontologies. The intensive exchange with researchers from so many disciplines was incredibly inspiring. I return to Vienna with a head full of ideas, exciting contacts, and a great deal of motivation.
