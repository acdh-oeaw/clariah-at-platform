CLARIAH-AT is the consortium of Austrian universities and research institutions that coordinates and drives Austrian activities in the European ESFRI research infrastructures [CLARIN-ERIC](https://www.clarin.eu/) (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) and [DARIAH-EU](https://www.dariah.eu/) (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities).

The consortium brings together Austrian institutions with relevant expertise in research, development and teaching in the field of Digital Humanities as well as in the establishment and sustainable operation of research (data) infrastructures, which also play an active role in the Austrian development of Digital Humanities and the establishment and expansion of technical and social infrastructures for the humanities in general.

Austrian researchers were involved in both research infrastructures during the preparatory phase and have made substantial contributions to them at both the local and European levels. Thanks to the support of the then Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy, Austria was able to become a founding member of both consortia (CLARIN 2012, DARIAH 2014). In 2014, the Austrian Academy of Sciences was entrusted by the Federal Ministry of Science and Research with the coordination of local activities. In June 2019, the core group of CLARIAH-AT reconstituted itself by signing a consortium agreement between the participating institutions, which was extended indefinitely in March 2021.

## CLARIAH-AT Advisory Board

In addition to networking and collaboration with Austrian institutions and colleagues from the fields of Digital Humanities, memory institutions and research data management, we strive to involve representatives of the pertinent ministries and research funding bodies directly in both our communication and strategy.

The advisory board provides an opportunity for direct communication between the consortium and DH community, and the ministries and funding bodies, in order to define and implement strategies and efficient measures for the sustainable further development of Digital Humanities in Austria.

## Earlier Activities

Part of earlier CLARIAH-AT activities were the three [go!digital calls](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/foerderungen/godigital) in 2014, 2016 and 2018, which were competitively advertised and organized by the Austrian Academy of Sciences with funding from the Austrian National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development. The 30 projects selected by international experts promote the development and use of innovative digital methods in Austrian humanities research. In addition, 20 CLARIAH-AT funded projects are in the implementation phase (or have recently been completed).
