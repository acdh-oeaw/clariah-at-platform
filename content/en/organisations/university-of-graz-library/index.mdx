The Graz University Library is one of the largest cultural and educational institutions in Styria with around 4 million information carriers. It is a library with universal aspirations, a scientific orientation and a public mission for the entire region. It sees itself as a “hybrid library” that acquires, manages, archives, processes and makes available both analog and digital media in the spirit of sustainable development. In addition, the library offers a comprehensive range of courses, from research to publishing scientific results; for the latter, there are contact persons in the areas of publication services and research data management.
