Dealing with IT-related methodological research issues has long been a tradition at the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Graz. Since the 1990s, applied research in the field of information processing in the humanities has been used to amass a scientific technical IT infrastructure and subject-specific expertise in the development and implementation of digital research methods in the humanities. This expertise has been brought into wider teaching and the university’s commitment to this field of research was cemented in 2008 with the establishment of the (fromerly) ‘Centre for Information Modelling in the Humanities’ (*Zentrum für Informationsmodellierung in den Geisteswissenschaften*), which is now the ‘Department of Digital Humanities’ (*Institut für Digitale Geisteswissenschaften*). In terms of content, *digital editions* form the central research topic at the Department. These are understood to be widely applicable methods in the humanities for the semantic and formal indexing of cultural artefacts. This is not only applicable to texts, but also to other media forms of digital representations of cultural heritage, too. In addition to digital methods for the indexing analysis of humanities research data, the Centre is also keenly interested in the sustainable preservation and long-term archiving of humanities data. This is shown by the sustainable and continuous development of the research data repository, GAMS (*Geisteswissenschaftliches Asset Management System*).
