Aside from conceptual and technical expertise, and curatorial skills needed for the digitisation of cultural heritage, the Department also focuses on mediation. This includes topics such as media didactics, as well as legal, ethical and social issues in the field of Open Science and in the provision of free, public access to digital resources in research and teaching. As one of the leading Austrian institutions for digital humanities, the Department of Digital Humanities is a member of organisations DHd (Digital Humanities in the German-speaking Region) and centerNet (the International Network of Digital Humanities Centres), as well as numerous other international research frameworks (e.g. CLARIN-ERIC, DARIAH-EU) and professional organisations (e.g. TEI, ICARUS, RDA). The ADHO (Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations) has also entrusted us with the organisation of their international annual conference in 2023.
